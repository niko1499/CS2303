General repository for CS2303 test cases C2017

This repository holds files for testing CS2303 PA5. Per the open collaboration policy defined in the project description, these test files are free for anyone to use.

General test file guidelines:

Upload two .txt files: one with test cases to be read by the program and another that resembles how the output of that file should look. The first file should be named test_#.txt where # is a unique identifier for the file. The associated output file should be test_#_key.txt with the same identifier.
