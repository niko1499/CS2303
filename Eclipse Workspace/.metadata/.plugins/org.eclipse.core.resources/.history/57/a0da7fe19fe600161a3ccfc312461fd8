# This makefile is used as follows to regenerate files for the sinewave program:
#   make Life.o   --  Regenerates Life.o by compiling
#   make Game.o   --  Regenerates Game.o by compiling
#   make Game     --  Regenerates the executable Game file by compiling
#   make              --  Same as "make Game"
#

CFLAGS = -g

Life: Life.o Game.o Board.o
	gcc $(CFLAGS) -Wall Game.o Life.o Board.o -lm -o Life 

Life.o: Life.h Life.c
	gcc $(CFLAGS) -Wall -lm -c Life.c

Game.o: Life.h Board.h Game.c
	gcc $(CFLAGS) -Wall -lm -c Game.c

Board.o: Life.h Board.c
